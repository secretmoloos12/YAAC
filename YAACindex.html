<p>YAAC ( Young Adult Advisory Club ) is a Youth Organization in Kosovo Prizren.
<br>
We want to keep the Nature clean, and also have fun.
<br>
Young Adult Advisory Club aims to bring people together through activities that help our community.
<br>
Pliking, or picking up trash while hiking , is a keystone activity the club does in Marash.
<br>
We believe one of the things that makes Prizren a great city is the close by nature of Marash.
<br>
We enjoy walking through and picking up the trash we can . We believe that access to nature improves quality of life for citizens and it is fun to get together.
<br>
Other activities involve making and handing out kindness cards. This arts and craft is fun and helps spread positivity in the city.
<br>
Other ideas in the making are letter writing, baking dog treats for homeless dogs, and reading to the olderly.
<br>
The club meets at <a href="https://prizren.ackosovo.com/" target="blank">American Corner</a> every other Friday at 1 PM ( 13:00 ).
